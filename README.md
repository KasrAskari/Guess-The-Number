# Guess The Number 🎲  

**A fun and interactive game to challenge your guessing skills!**  

---

## 🎯 Overview  
This Python-based project consists of two versions of the number-guessing game:  
1. **User Guess:** The user tries to guess the number randomly generated by the system.  
2. **System Guess:** The system guesses a number chosen by the user.  

Each version provides an engaging experience with clear feedback mechanisms to guide the guesses.

## 🚀 Features  
- Two game modes:  
  - **User Guess Mode:** The user guesses the number.  
  - **System Guess Mode:** The system guesses the user's number.  
- Adjustable range for number generation (e.g., 1-100).  
- Feedback for each guess (higher or lower).  
- Tracks the number of attempts.  
- Simple and user-friendly interface.

## 🛠️ How It Works  

### **1. User Guess Mode**  
1. The system generates a random number within a predefined range.  
2. The user inputs guesses.  
3. The program provides feedback: "Too High" or "Too Low."  
4. The game ends when the user guesses the correct number.  

### **2. System Guess Mode**  
1. The user selects a number secretly within the range.  
2. The system makes guesses and adjusts based on user feedback ("higher" or "lower").  
3. The system continues until it correctly identifies the user's number.
